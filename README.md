# ASL-Gesture-Recognition

This repository shows the project that I have done in the Intelligent Interactive Systems course at the Uppsala University. 
The project is about implementing a Convolutional Neural Network, that identifies Gestures according to ASL standards.

The following gestures were implemented:

Each student had to upload a video with hand gestures for each ASL letter, which was then aggregated to one Dataset. The Dataset is property of Ginevra Castellano, therefore it is not included in the repo. My videos are available as an example.
